                Hey there! Before you dive into using our CinemaGhar app, we just want to make sure you understand the ground rules.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Introduction</h2>

            <p className="mb-4">
                By using our service, you’re agreeing to these terms. If you don’t agree, that’s cool, but you might want to skip using the app.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Basic Stuff</h2>

            <p className="mb-4">
                This app is all about booking movie tickets, checking out what’s showing, and getting the latest movie news. We’re working hard to make it awesome, but we’re not perfect, so please bear with us if things don’t always go smoothly.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Your Account</h2>

            <p className="mb-4">
                You’re responsible for your account. Keep your password safe and don’t share it with others. If something fishy happens, let us know ASAP.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Using the App</h2>

            <p className="mb-4">
                Feel free to explore the app, but remember to use it responsibly. No hacking, spamming, or anything shady, okay?
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Content</h2>

            <p className="mb-4">
                We try to keep the content fresh and fun, but if you spot something that’s not right, please give us a heads-up.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Third-Party Links</h2>

            <p className="mb-4">
                Sometimes, we might link to other sites. They’re not under our control, so we can’t be responsible for what happens there.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Changes to These Terms</h2>

            <p className="mb-4">
                We might update these terms once in a while. If we do, we’ll let you know. Keep an eye out so you’re always in the loop.
            </p>
